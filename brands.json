Gift cards are valid for at least 12 months after the date of purchase. Where local legislation prescribes a longer expiration term and this 12-month period has already passed, making you unable to redeem your gift card, please contact the local customer services department of Just Eat who will be able to support you. \r\n\r\n15. Any unused credit will be treated as a forfeiture by you in respect of the right to use the gift card and the unused credit can no longer be redeemed.

Bol.com se réserve le droit d’accepter un bon-cadeau seulement après réception du bon-cadeau original (ou en cas de bon-cadeau électronique, de l’e-mail envoyé par bol.com ou par un partenaire tiers approuvé par bol.com et contenant le code) et de réclamer la somme en cas d’utilisation détournée.

Der aktuelle Saldo des Guthabens kann jederzeit an einer Kasse eines Schweizer MediaMarktes nach Wahl des Kunden oder hier online abgefragt werden. Eine Barauszahlung oder eine anderweitige Gutschrift des Guthabens ist ausgeschlossen. Das Guthaben wird nicht verzinst. Es verfällt nach Ablauf von fünf Jahren ab Erhalt der Geschenkkarte.

SAISIE DE VOTRE COMMANDE EN LIGNE</h3>\r\n<p>La saisie de la commande se fait selon les instructions précisées en ligne.</p>\r\n<p>Le Client s'engage à compléter les champs obligatoires (marqués *), à défaut de quoi, la commande ne pourra être enregistrée.</p>\r\n<p>Le Client s'engage à nous communiquer des informations sincères, nous nous réservons le droit d'opposer un refus de vente dans le cas contraire.</p>\r\n<p>La commande est enregistrée après création du compte client et validation de la commande en ligne.</p>\r\n<p>La commande en ligne n'est effective qu'après la validation du paiement du Client. Le Client reçoit alors un email d'accusé de réception de commande. Il est précisé qu’en cas d’achat de Carte Cadeau personnalisée, le traitement de la commande pourra être plus long.</p>\r\n<p>Les commandes confirmées sont traitées et expédiées, après réception du paiement, du lundi au vendredi, hors jours fériés. En cas d'incident empêchant le traitement de la commande du Client, celle-ci est annulée et le paiement est annulé et/ou remboursé. Le remboursement est effectué par virement sur le compte bancaire du Client ayant effectué la transaction initiale. Une confirmation de remboursement est adressée par email au Client.</p>\r\n<p>Le Client reconnait que les commandes passées auprès de notre service sont fermes et définitives et ne pourront en aucune façon donner lieu à remboursement ni être annulées, sauf application du droit de rétractation. A aucun moment, les sommes encaissées ne pourront être considérées comme des arrhes ou des acomptes.</p>\r\n<p>Il est de la responsabilité du Client de s'assurer que les coordonnées qu'il a communiquées lors de sa commande sont correctes et qu'elles permettront au destinataire de recevoir la commande et au Client la confirmation de celle-ci; DECATHLON Carte Cadeau déclinant toute responsabilité en cas d'erreur du Client. Dans l'hypothèse où le Client ne recevrait pas cette confirmation, il lui incombe de nous contacter.</p>\r\n<p>La fourniture en ligne de numéro de carte bancaire et la validation de la commande vaudront preuve de l'intégralité de la dite commande et de l'exigibilité des sommes engagées, conformément aux dispositions de la loi du 13 mars 2000. Cette validation vaut signature et acceptation expresse des opérations effectuées sur le Site.</p>\r\n<h3>C. DISPONIBILITE</h3>\r\n<p>Nos offres de produits et de services sont valables aussi longtemps qu'elles sont visibles sur le Site, sauf opérations spéciales dont la durée de validité est spécifiée sur le Site.</p>\r\n<p>En cas de commande d'un ou de plusieurs articles qui se révélerai(en)t indisponible(s), le Client sera informé et pourra à sa convenance choisir l’une des options suivantes :</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>DECATHLON Carte Cadeau se réserve le droit de proposer un produit d’une qualité et d’un prix équivalent ou supérieur, sans frais supplémentaire pour le Client et sous réserve de l’acceptation de ce dernier ;</li>\r\n<li>annuler la commande de l’article indisponible.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>En cas de commande de plusieurs produits, si l'un des produits se révèle indisponible, DECATHLON Carte Cadeau informera alors le Client. L’ensemble de la commande ne sera traité et expédié que lorsque l'ensemble des produits de cette commande sera disponible, sauf si le Client décide de recevoir en priorité les articles disponibles de sa commande. Le Client ne sera alors facturé que des frais de ports annoncés au moment de la commande pour les deux livraisons. Le Client peut également opter pour l’annulation partielle de sa commande concernant les produits indisponibles.</p>\r\n<h3>D. PREUVE DE LA COMMANDE/PAIEMENT</h3>\r\n<p>Sauf preuve contraire, nos registres informatiques et ceux de nos prestataires, conservés dans des conditions raisonnables de sécurité, constitueront la preuve de l'ensemble des transactions passées entre DECATHLON Carte Cadeau et le Client. Conformément à la règlementation en vigueur, DECATHLON Carte Cadeau procède à un archivage des commandes sur un support fiable. Le Client pourra y avoir accès sur le Site dans l'espace \"\" Mon compte \"\". Dans tous les cas, DECATHLON Carte Cadeau recommande au Client de conserver l'e-mail de validation de sa commande ainsi que sa facture.</p>\r\n<h2>ARTICLE 3 - FACTURATION ET MODALITES DE PAIEMENT</h2>\r\n<p>Les prix affichés par défaut sur le Site sont indiqués en euros et toutes charges comprises.</p>\r\n<p>Les Cartes Cadeaux sont des produits monétiques non assujettis à la TVA.</p>\r\n<p>Les prix de nos offres sont valables aussi longtemps qu'ils sont visibles sur le Site, sauf opérations spéciales dont la durée de validité est spécifiée sur le Site et sous réserve de modification du taux de TVA applicable. Tout changement de ce taux pourrait alors être répercuté immédiatement sur les prix de vente.</p>\r\n<p>Les prix des produits s'entendent hors frais de port, prix de certains emballages ou encore prix d'autres services optionnels, souscrits par le Client, qui restent en sus. Ces derniers seront portés à la connaissance du Client sur l'écran récapitulatif avant validation définitive de la commande.</p>\r\n<p>DECATHLON Carte Cadeau se réserve le droit de modifier à tout moment les tarifs. Le tarif en vigueur est celui applicable au jour de la commande.</p>\r\n<p>La facturation est libellée au nom du Client (nom, adresse) et est émise à la validation de la commande. Elle est ensuite disponible et téléchargeable sur l’espace du Client.</p>\r\n<p>L'achat de Cartes Cadeaux ou autres produits monétiques ne peut être effectué avec des Cartes Cadeaux. Toutes les commandes sont payables en euros.</p>\r\n<p>DECATHLON Carte Cadeau accepte les cartes bancaires suivantes = Carte Bancaire, Visa et Mastercard.</p>\r\n<p>Dans le cas de contrôles anti-fraude ayant pour but de sécuriser les transactions de ses Clients, DECATHLON Carte Cadeau sera en droit de demander au Client de fournir un ou plusieurs justificatifs de domicile et/ou copie de carte d'identité par e-mail ou fax avant de valider sa commande.</p>\r\n<p>La commande ne sera alors définitive qu'à réception, par DECATHLON Carte Cadeau, de ces documents et envoi d'un e-mail de confirmation. A défaut de la réception de ces pièces ou si celles-ci ne permettent pas.",
